# Commingle Money

A Flutter package for working with monetary values, open sourced from the [Commingle](https://commingle.app) app. It includes global currency definitions, widgets for displaying amounts, input controllers for smooth, user-friendly editing and other monetary utilities.

`MoneyLabel` is a rich and flexible widget for presenting `Money` values.

- **Odometer-style animations** for amount changes
- Configurable **decimal behavior** - e.g. round, show when needed…
- Currency and negative sign display choice  
- Custom colors for positive, negative, and zero values
- Full control over **text styles**

```dart
MoneyLabel(
  money: Money(
    currencyCode: 'USD', 
    amount: Decimal.parse('1234.56')
  ),
  fractionalMode: MoneyLabelFractionalMode.flexible,
  displayCurrency: true,
  displayNegativeSign: true,
  separators: AmountFormatSeparatorsData(
    grouping: 
    decimal: 
  ),
  animation: MoneyLabelAnimation(
    duration: 
    curve: 
  ),
  primaryTextStyle: Theme.of(context).textTheme.bodyLarge,
  secondaryTextStyle: Theme.of(context).textTheme.bodySmall,
  positiveColor: Colors.green,
  negativeColor: Colors.red,
  zeroColor: Colors.grey
  primaryTextStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
)
```

You can wrap your app with the `MoneyLabelDefaults` inherited widget to provide default styles, colors, and behavior for all `MoneyLabel` instances.

## 💳 Money Editing Controller

<img src="https://github.com/chris-rutkowski/commingle_money/raw/main/readme_assets/money_editing_controller.gif" width="203" height="122" title="MoneyEditingController demo"/>


`MoneyEditingController` is a powerful controller you can assign to any `TextField` to handle monetary input with precision, formatting, and validation. It supports:

- Simple input
- Formula input - user can type `2 + 3(4 - 2) ÷ 5 × 1.5`
- Automatic rounding and formatting when unfocused

```dart
final controller = MoneyEditingController(
  currencyCode: CurrencyCodes.usd, // or "USD"
  amount: Decimal.parse("123.45"),
  separators: AmountFormatSeparatorsData(
    grouping: 
    decimal: 
  ),
);

TextField(
  controller: controller.textController,
  focusNode: controller.focusNode,
  keyboardType: const TextInputType.numberWithOptions(decimal: true),
)
```

You can listen to changes as the user types:

```dart
controller.addListener(() {
  final amount = controller.value;
  // your code
});
```

You can also set the value programmatically using `value` setter or to just change a currency  using `currencyCode` setter.

### 🔢 Amount Editing Controller

`AmountEditingController` is a lightweight alternative to `MoneyEditingController` that operates directly on `Decimal` values. It lets you control the desired precision without involving currency logic.

## 💵 Money

`Money` is a simple yet powerful value class that combines a `currencyCode` with a `Decimal` amount.

```dart
Money(
  currencyCode: CurrencyCodes.usd, // or simply "USD"
  amount: Decimal.parse("123.45"),
);
```

It provides utility methods like:

-  `rounded()`: 2.99 → 3 
-  `roundedToCurrencyPrecision()`: 2.567 → 2.57.

You can also use math operators directly: `+ – × ÷`. All operations return a new `Money` instance, rounded to the currency precision. You can combine `Money` values of the same currency with `int`, `double`, or `Decimal` values.


```dart
final usd3 = Money(currencyCode: "USD", amount: Decimal.fromInt(3))
final usd4 = Money(currencyCode: "USD", amount: Decimal.fromInt(4))

final total = usd3 + usd4 + 5; // = 12 USD
```

## 🌍 Currency

The library includes a comprehensive list of **155 worldwide currencies**, each with detailed metadata.

```dart
final usd = Currency.fromCode("USD");

// Result:
Currency(
  code: 'USD',
  englishName: 'United States Dollar',
  precision: 2,
  emojiFlag: '🇺🇸',
  symbol: '$',
  englishCountryNames: {
    'United States',
    'Ecuador',
    'El Salvador',
    'Panama',
    …
  },
),
```

You can retrieve all currencies using: `Currency.list()`, or filter them as user types:

```dart
Currency.list((c) => c.englishName.contains(searchQuery))
```

You can also use constants like `CurrencyCodes.chf` for quick access to a curated subset of popular currencies.

## 🧮 Decimal Utilities

`DecimalUtils` is an extension on `Decimal` that provides helpful utilities for rounding, scaling, and working with numeric data in a finance-friendly way.

- `round2()` rounds the decimal to two decimal places (unless `scale` is provided).
- `upperBound` and `lowerBound` help round values to chart-friendly boundaries,  
  e.g. `1234.56` → `1300` (upper), `1200` (lower).
- utility functions like `min`, `max`, and `sum`
- converters `Decimal` → `int` as well as `double` → `Decimal`

## ⚠️ Known Issues

Aligning `MoneyLabel` precisely to the baseline can be tricky. By design, the widget displays the currency symbol and decimal part using a smaller font than the main number.

I experimented with multiple approaches - `CrossAxisAlignment.baseline`, `RichText` and even low-level `TextPainter` font metrics. None produced fully reliable results across fonts, especially with Odometer animation.

As a workaround, the widget exposes `secondaryPadding` property that lets you manually tweak the vertical alignment of secondary elements. While not ideal, this gives you full control to fine-tune the appearance for your chosen font and style.

## 🙌 Acknowledgements

This library wouldn’t be possible without the excellent work of the Flutter community.

[decimal](https://pub.dev/packages/decimal), [equatable](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable), [expressions](https://pub.dev/packages/expressions), [animated_flip_counter](animated_flip_counter)

While not part of the core library, I recommend using [locale_plus](https://pub.dev/packages/locale_plus) like demonstrated in Example app.
